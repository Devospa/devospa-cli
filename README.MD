# Devospa Cli
Devospa lets frontend developers easily demo the changes they have made on their SPA project before it gets merged or even pushed.

The cli zips the built folder of the project and send it to [Devospa.com](http://devospa.com).

## Getting Started with Devospa
Go to [Devospa.com](http://devospa.com) and click on the start button.

## How to use
You can use it via npx as the following command without installation
```
npx devospa push given_token_in_devospa.com build
```
or install it globally
```
npm i -g devospa
devospa push given_token_in_devospa.com build
```
